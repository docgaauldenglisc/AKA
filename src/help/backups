<span weight='bold' size='xx-large'>Backups</span>

<b>Backups</b> are <b>Saves</b> or <b>Files</b>,
that contain <b>Contacts</b> someone has saved.

They end in <b>.db</b>.

You can make a <b>Save</b> open by default,
by replacing the <b>Default Save</b> (<b>Contacts.db</b>),

in the directory with the AKA executable inside of it.
